## Introduction
In this project, we analyze a series of FCF (Fetal Heart Rate) in order to create a digital tool that can recognize known patterns using SSIM and can find new patterns using Corner Detection (particularly Shi-Tomasi) and by joining the corners. All of this with the use of libraries such as OpenCV, fitz, matplotlib, numpy, etc...

## Results
We achieved what we wanted
